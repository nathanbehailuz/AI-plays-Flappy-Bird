# AI Plays Flappy Bird

This project demonstrates how an AI agent can be trained to play the popular game Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning. The AI uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural networks that control the bird.

## Features

- **NEAT Algorithm:** Utilizes NEAT for evolving neural networks.
- **Game Simulation:** Simulates the Flappy Bird game for the AI to train and play.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the AI playing the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanbehailuz/AI-plays-Flappy-Bird.git
   cd AI-plays-Flappy-Bird
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the AI and watch it play, simply run:
```bash
python flappy_bird_ai.py
```
